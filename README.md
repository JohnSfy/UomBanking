# UomBanking
This repository includes the code of a full stack java application for a group project in the course of "Software Engineering". The UomBanking application demonstrates an e-banking system, that gives the ability to do transactions, take loans, create cards and more. 

FOR DEVS: 1) Make sure to load this code in a maven project.
          2) Check the versions in the pom.xml file, because they might be outdated.
          3) If you want to use your own database, go in the hibernate.cfg.xml and change the connection url.
          4) You don't need to install any libraries, because the maven project does that for you.
          5) If you change the version of Hibernate, you might need to change the SQLite dialect dependency.
          6) Load this project in Intellij IDEA, because ECLIPSE has a problem with the packages.
          7) For SDK use the openJDK 20.0.1
          8) To run the application, run the App class in gui package
